# üìä Structured Output: Making Agents Return Perfect Data

## üéØ What is Structured Output?

Think of **Structured Output** like **ordering from a restaurant with a specific form**. Instead of saying "give me some food" and getting random items, you fill out a precise order form that guarantees you get exactly what you want in the right format.

### üßí Simple Analogy: The Order Form

**Without Structured Output (Messy)**:
- You: "Tell me about the weather"
- Agent: "It's pretty nice today, maybe around 75 degrees and sunny in New York"
- You: üòï "How do I extract the temperature? What city? Is it Fahrenheit or Celsius?"

**With Structured Output (Perfect)**:
- You: "Tell me about the weather"
- Agent: `{"location": "New York", "temperature_c": 24, "summary": "sunny"}`
- You: üòé "Perfect! I can use this data directly in my app!"

---

## üìä The Core Concept

**Regular Output (Unpredictable)**:
```python
# Agent returns free-form text
result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "What's the weather in Karachi?")
print(result.final_output)
# "The weather in Karachi is quite warm today, around 30 degrees Celsius with clear skies."
# Problem: How do you extract the temperature? The format changes every time!
```

**Structured Output (Predictable)**:
```python
# Agent returns structured data
class WeatherAnswer(BaseModel):
    location: str
    temperature_c: float
    summary: str

agent = Agent(output_type=WeatherAnswer)
result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "What's the weather in Karachi?")

# Perfect! Now you get structured data:
print(result.final_output.location)      # "Karachi"
print(result.final_output.temperature_c) # 30.0
print(result.final_output.summary)       # "clear skies"
```

---

## üîß How Structured Output Works

### **The Magic Behind the Scenes**

When you use structured output, the agent:

1. **Understands the Schema**: Knows exactly what fields to fill
2. **Validates the Data**: Ensures all required fields are present
3. **Formats Correctly**: Returns data in the exact structure you specified
4. **Type Checks**: Guarantees temperature is a number, not text

```python
# What happens automatically:
class PersonInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str          # Must be text
    age: int           # Must be a whole number
    email: str         # Must be text
    is_student: bool   # Must be True/False

# Agent MUST return data in this exact format
# If it tries to return invalid data, it gets corrected automatically!
```

### **Pydantic Models - Your Data Blueprint**

| Component | What It Does | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Class Definition** | Creates the data structure | `class WeatherInfo(BaseModel):` |
| **Field Types** | Specifies what kind of data | `temperature: float` |
| **Required Fields** | Must be included | All fields are required by default |
| **Optional Fields** | Can be missing | `rainfall: Optional[float] = None` |

---

## üéØ Baby Steps Examples

### 1. **Your First Structured Output**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from agents import Agent, Runner

# Define your data structure
class PersonInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    occupation: str

# Create agent with structured output
agent = Agent(
    name="InfoCollector",
    instructions="Extract person information from the user's message.",
    output_type=PersonInfo  # This is the magic!
)

# Test it
result = Runner.run_sync(
    agent, 
    "Hi, I'm Alice, I'm 25 years old and I work as a teacher."
)

# Now you get perfect structured data!
print("Type:", type(result.final_output))        # <class 'PersonInfo'>
print("Name:", result.final_output.name)         # "Alice"
print("Age:", result.final_output.age)           # 25
print("Job:", result.final_output.occupation)    # "teacher"
```

### 2. **Different Data Types**

```python
from typing import Optional, List
from datetime import datetime

class ProductInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str                           # Text
    price: float                        # Decimal number
    in_stock: bool                      # True/False
    categories: List[str]               # List of text items
    discount_percent: Optional[int] = 0 # Optional number, default 0
    reviews_count: int                  # Whole number

# Create product info extractor
agent = Agent(
    name="ProductExtractor",
    instructions="Extract product information from product descriptions.",
    output_type=ProductInfo
)

# Test with product description
result = Runner.run_sync(
    agent,
    "The iPhone 15 Pro costs $999.99, it's available in electronics and smartphones categories, currently in stock with 1,247 reviews."
)

print("Product:", result.final_output.name)         # "iPhone 15 Pro"
print("Price:", result.final_output.price)          # 999.99
print("In Stock:", result.final_output.in_stock)    # True
print("Categories:", result.final_output.categories) # ["electronics", "smartphones"]
print("Reviews:", result.final_output.reviews_count) # 1247
```
