# Step 03: Custom Entity & Edge Types - Making Knowledge Graphs Domain-Specific

Now that you understand episodes, let's make your knowledge graphs much more precise by defining custom types for your educational domain.

## üìö Official Documentation

- [Custom Entity and Edge Types](https://help.getzep.com/graphiti/core-concepts/custom-entity-and-edge-types) - Complete guide to custom types

## üéØ What You'll Learn

By the end of this step, you will:
- Define custom entity types (like `Student`, `Course`, `Instructor`)
- Create custom edge types (like `ENROLLED_IN`, `TEACHES`, `COMPLETED`)
- Use Pydantic models to add rich attributes and validation
- Apply custom types to episodes for precise knowledge extraction
- Search with type filters for targeted results

## üìã Prerequisites

- Completed Steps 01 and 02
- Understanding of episodes and basic Graphiti operations
- Basic knowledge of Python classes and type hints

## üìö Why Custom Types Matter

### The Problem with Generic Types

**Without Custom Types:**
```
Generic entities: "person", "thing", "concept", "event"
Generic relationships: "relates_to", "connected_to", "associated_with"
```

**Result:** Vague, hard-to-query knowledge graphs with unclear semantics

### The Power of Custom Types

**With Custom Types:**
```
Educational entities: Student, Course, Instructor, Assignment, Skill
Educational relationships: ENROLLED_IN, TEACHES, COMPLETED, MASTERED, STRUGGLES_WITH
```

**Result:** Precise, queryable, domain-specific knowledge that understands your educational context

### Key Benefits

- **Semantic Precision**: Know exactly what each entity represents
- **Rich Attributes**: Store domain-specific data (GPA, course credits, skill levels)
- **Better Queries**: Search for specific types of information  
- **Guided LLM**: Help AI extract the right types of information from episodes
- **Type Safety**: Validate data structure and catch errors early

## üèóÔ∏è **Understanding Custom Types Architecture**

### Entity Types vs Edge Types

**Entity Types** define "things" in your domain:
- `Student` - a learner with attributes like GPA, major, learning style
- `Course` - a class with credits, difficulty, prerequisites
- `Instructor` - a teacher with experience, specialization, department
- `Skill` - a competency with difficulty level, category

**Edge Types** define "relationships" between things:
- `Enrollment` - student ‚Üî course relationship with grade, semester, status
- `TeachingAssignment` - instructor ‚Üî course relationship with schedule, section
- `SkillDevelopment` - student ‚Üî skill relationship with proficiency, evidence
- `PrerequisiteRelationship` - course ‚Üî course dependency with strength

### Using Pydantic for Type Definition

Graphiti uses **Pydantic BaseModel** for custom types. This provides:
- **Type validation** - ensures data integrity
- **Rich attributes** - structured fields with descriptions
- **Documentation** - built-in schema generation
- **IDE support** - autocomplete and type checking

## üöÄ Complete Working Example

Let's build comprehensive educational types:

## üß™ Try It Yourself

### Exercise 1: Add More Custom Types

Extend the example with additional educational types:

```python
class Department(BaseModel):
    """Academic department"""
    department_name: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Official department name")
    building_location: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Main building location")
    faculty_count: Optional[int] = Field(None, description="Number of faculty members")
    research_areas: Optional[List[str]] = Field(None, description="Primary research focuses")

class Textbook(BaseModel):
    """Course textbook or resource"""
    isbn: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="International Standard Book Number")
    author: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Book author(s)")
    edition: Optional[int] = Field(None, description="Book edition number")
    required: Optional[bool] = Field(None, description="Whether textbook is required")

# Add to your entity_types dictionary
entity_types["Department"] = Department
entity_types["Textbook"] = Textbook
```

### Exercise 2: Advanced Edge Types

Create more complex relationship types:

```python
class PrerequisiteRelationship(BaseModel):
    """Course prerequisite relationship"""
    requirement_type: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Hard prerequisite, recommended, corequisite")
    minimum_grade: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Minimum grade required")
    waiver_possible: Optional[bool] = Field(None, description="Can prerequisite be waived")
    established_date: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="When requirement was established")

class MentorshipRelationship(BaseModel):
    """Student-instructor mentorship"""
    mentorship_type: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Academic, research, career")
    start_date: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="When mentorship began")
    meeting_frequency: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Weekly, monthly, as-needed")
    focus_areas: Optional[List[str]] = Field(None, description="Areas of mentorship focus")
```

### Exercise 3: Type Validation

Add Pydantic validators for data quality:

```python
from pydantic import validator

class Student(BaseModel):
    age: Optional[int] = Field(None, description="Student's age")
    gpa: Optional[float] = Field(None, description="Current GPA (0.0-4.0)")
    
    @validator('age')
    def age_must_be_reasonable(cls, v):
        if v is not None and (v < 16 or v > 65):
            raise ValueError('Age must be between 16 and 65')
        return v
    
    @validator('gpa')
    def gpa_must_be_valid(cls, v):
        if v is not None and (v < 0.0 or v > 4.0):
            raise ValueError('GPA must be between 0.0 and 4.0')
        return v
```

## üéØ Key Concepts Explained

### How Custom Types Guide LLM Extraction

**Without Custom Types:**
```
"Alice enrolled in CS101" ‚Üí Generic entities: "person", "thing"
```

**With Custom Types:**
```
"Alice enrolled in CS101" ‚Üí Specific entities: Student("Alice"), Course("CS101")
                          ‚Üí Specific relationship: Enrollment(semester="Fall 2024")
```

### Edge Type Mapping Strategy

The `edge_type_map` tells Graphiti which relationships can exist:

```python
edge_type_map = {
    ("Student", "Course"): ["Enrollment"],           # Students can enroll in courses
    ("Instructor", "Course"): ["TeachingAssignment"], # Instructors can teach courses
    ("Student", "Skill"): ["SkillDevelopment"],      # Students can develop skills
    ("Course", "Course"): ["PrerequisiteRelationship"], # Courses can require other courses
    ("Entity", "Entity"): ["RELATES_TO"]             # Fallback for unexpected relationships
}
```

### Benefits of Rich Attributes

Custom types allow storing detailed, structured information:

```python
# Instead of just knowing "Alice enrolled in CS101"
# You get rich relationship data:
Enrollment(
    enrollment_date="2024-08-28",
    status="Active", 
    semester="Fall 2024",
    midterm_grade="B+",
    final_grade=None  # Still in progress
)
```

### Search Filter Advantages

With custom types, you can search precisely:

```python
# Find only students and courses
SearchFilters(node_labels=["Student", "Course"])

# Find only enrollment relationships  
SearchFilters(edge_types=["Enrollment"])

# Combine both for very targeted searches
SearchFilters(
    node_labels=["Student"], 
    edge_types=["SkillDevelopment"]
)
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Custom entity types defined with meaningful attributes
- [ ] Custom edge types capture relationship details
- [ ] Edge type mapping covers expected relationships
- [ ] Episodes processed with custom type guidance
- [ ] Search results show domain-specific entities and relationships
- [ ] Type filtering working (where supported)

## ü§î Common Questions

**Q: What's the difference between episodes and custom types?**
A: Episodes are the raw data you input. Custom types guide how Graphiti extracts and structures that data into precise entities and relationships.

**Q: Can I change custom types after adding episodes?**
A: Yes, but you may need to re-process episodes to get the new type structure. Plan your types carefully upfront.

**Q: How many custom types should I create?**
A: Start with 3-5 core entity types and 2-3 key relationship types. Add more as you discover what you need.

**Q: Do I need to use all the optional fields?**
A: No! Pydantic's Optional fields mean you can use what you have. Empty fields are fine.

## üìù What You Learned

‚úÖ **Domain-Specific Types**: Defined precise educational entities instead of generic nodes
‚úÖ **Rich Relationships**: Created meaningful edge types with detailed attributes
‚úÖ **Pydantic Models**: Used structured, validated data models for type safety
‚úÖ **LLM Guidance**: Helped Graphiti extract exactly the information you need
‚úÖ **Targeted Search**: Used type filters for precise knowledge retrieval
‚úÖ **Educational Schema**: Built a complete academic domain model

## üéØ Next Steps

**Excellent progress!** You now have precise, domain-specific knowledge graphs instead of generic entities and relationships.

**Ready to discover patterns automatically?** Continue to **[04_communities](../04_communities/)** where you'll learn how Graphiti automatically finds groups and clusters in your knowledge graph.

**What's Coming**: Instead of manually organizing information, you'll see how Graphiti discovers that certain students struggle with similar topics, or that certain teaching methods work well together - all automatically!

**Key Takeaway**: Custom types transform generic knowledge graphs into precise, domain-specific knowledge systems. Start with your most important entities and relationships, then expand as needed! üöÄ

*"The best custom types emerge from understanding your domain deeply and starting with the most essential entities and relationships."*
