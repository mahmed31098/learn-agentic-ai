## üéØ What You'll Learn

- **Build knowledge graphs** from any text, conversations, or data
- **Search and retrieve** information using semantic queries  
- **Create custom types** for your specific domain
- **Deploy production agentic memory systems** with MCP integration
- **Master temporal patterns** for AI agent memory

## üìö Learning Path

We follow proven learning principles:
- **Start simple** with working examples
- **Build complexity** step by step
- **Practice immediately** with real code
- **Connect concepts** across steps

## üìñ Step-by-Step Learning

### **Phase 1: Core Concepts (Steps 01-04)**
*Learn the fundamentals through hands-on practice*

**Step 01: [Hello World](01_hello_world/)** - Your first knowledge graph  
*Get Graphiti running and see how text becomes structured knowledge*

**Step 02: [Adding Episodes](02_adding_episodes/)** - Different data types  
*Learn text, message, and JSON episodes with real examples*

**Step 03: [Custom Types](03_custom_types/)** - Domain-specific modeling  
*Create custom entities and relationships for your domain*

**Step 04: [Communities](04_communities/)** - Finding patterns  
*Discover how Graphiti groups related information automatically*

### **Phase 2: Advanced Features (Steps 05-08)**
*Build production-ready systems*

**Step 05: [Graph Namespacing](05_graph_namespacing/)** - Multi-tenant isolation  
*Separate data for different users or organizations*

**Step 06: [Searching](06_searching/)** - Advanced retrieval  
*Master semantic search, filtering, and optimization*

**Step 07: [CRUD Operations](07_crud_operations/)** - Direct manipulation  
*Work directly with nodes and edges when needed*

**Step 08: [Fact Triples](08_fact_triples/)** - Precise knowledge  
*Add structured facts for maximum precision*

### **Phase 3: Production Systems (Steps 09-12)**
*Deploy and scale your knowledge graphs*

**Step 09: [MCP Server](09_mcp_server/)** - AI assistant integration  
*Connect Graphiti to Claude, Cursor, and other AI tools*

**Step 10: [Configuration](10_configuration/)** - Performance optimization  
*Configure LLMs, databases, and performance settings*

**Step 11: [Zep Integration](11_zep_memory/)** - Production memory  
*Understand how Graphiti powers production AI systems*

**Step 12: [TutorsGPT Project](12_tutorsgpt_implementation/)** - Complete system  
*Build a full educational AI system using everything you've learned*

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Path

### **Each Step Includes**
1. **Clear explanation** of the concept
2. **Working code examples** you can run immediately  
3. **Hands-on exercises** to practice
4. **Real-world applications** and use cases
5. **Common issues** and how to solve them

### **Learning Approach**
- **Start with Step 01** and work through in order
- **Run all the code examples** - don't just read them
- **Try the exercises** before moving to the next step
- **Build on previous knowledge** as you progress
- **Ask questions** and experiment with variations

## üöÄ Prerequisites

### **Knowledge Prerequisites**
- Python 3.10+ programming
- Basic understanding of graphs (nodes/edges)
- Familiarity with AI/LLM concepts
- Experience with APIs and databases

### **Learning Environment**
- **Neo4j Database**: [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/) or [AuraDB](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/)
- **Code Editor**: VS Code or Cursor with Python extension recommended

1. **Start with [01_hello_world](01_hello_world/)** 

By completing this pathway, you won't just know Graphiti - you'll **think** with temporal knowledge graphs.
