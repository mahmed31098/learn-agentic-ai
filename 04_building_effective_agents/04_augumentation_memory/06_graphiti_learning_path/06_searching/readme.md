# Step 06: Searching - Hybrid Search and Advanced Retrieval

Now that you understand namespacing, let's master Graphiti's powerful search capabilities for finding exactly what you need in educational knowledge graphs.

## üìö Official Documentation

- [Searching](https://help.getzep.com/graphiti/working-with-data/searching) - Complete guide to search strategies

## üéØ What You'll Learn

By the end of this step, you will:
- Master hybrid search combining semantic similarity and BM25 retrieval
- Use node distance reranking for entity-specific queries
- Apply configurable search strategies with search recipes
- Implement different reranking approaches (RRF, MMR, Cross-Encoder)
- Design search solutions for educational scenarios

## üìã Prerequisites

- Completed Steps 01-05
- Understanding of namespacing and communities
- Knowledge graph with rich educational content

## üìö What is Hybrid Search?

### The Concept

Graphiti provides two main search approaches:

1. **Hybrid Search**: `await graphiti.search(query)`
   - Combines semantic similarity and BM25 retrieval
   - Reranked using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
   - Example: Broad retrieval of facts related to educational topics

2. **Node Distance Reranking**: `await graphiti.search(query, focal_node_uuid)`
   - Extends Hybrid Search by prioritizing results based on proximity to a specified node
   - Example: Focuses on student-specific information, highlighting their learning journey

### Search Components

**Configurable Search Strategies:**
Graphiti provides a low-level `graphiti._search()` method that is more configurable than the basic search. This method uses `SearchConfig` objects and returns `SearchResults` containing nodes, edges, and communities.

**Search Config Recipes:**
Graphiti includes 15 pre-built search recipes for common use cases:

| Recipe Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `COMBINED_HYBRID_SEARCH_RRF` | Hybrid search with RRF reranking over edges, nodes, and communities |
| `EDGE_HYBRID_SEARCH_RRF` | Hybrid search over edges with RRF reranking |
| `NODE_HYBRID_SEARCH_RRF` | Hybrid search over nodes with RRF reranking |
| `COMMUNITY_HYBRID_SEARCH_RRF` | Hybrid search over communities with RRF reranking |

### Supported Reranking Approaches

**Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**: Combines results from different algorithms (BM25 and semantic search) by converting ranks to reciprocal scores and summing them for final ranking.

**Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)**: Balances relevance and diversity by selecting results that are both relevant to the query and diverse from already chosen ones.

**Cross-Encoder**: Jointly encodes query and result, scoring their relevance by considering combined context. Graphiti supports:
- `OpenAIRerankerClient` (default)
- `GeminiRerankerClient` 
- `BGERerankerClient`

## üéØ Key Concepts Explained

### Search Strategy Selection

**Use Basic Hybrid Search when:**
- You want comprehensive results combining semantic and keyword matching
- You need broad discovery of related information
- You're exploring a topic without specific focus

**Use Node Distance Reranking when:**
- You want results focused on a specific entity (student, concept, course)
- You need personalized or entity-centric information
- You're analyzing patterns around a particular node

**Use Configurable Search when:**
- You need precise control over what types of results to return
- You want to focus on specific graph elements (nodes, edges, communities)
- You're implementing specialized search functionality

### Reranking Strategy Benefits

- **RRF**: Good general-purpose reranking combining multiple signals
- **MMR**: Provides diverse results, avoiding redundancy
- **Cross-Encoder**: Most accurate semantic relevance but slower

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Basic hybrid search working with educational content
- [ ] Understanding of node distance reranking concept
- [ ] Configurable search with recipes implemented
- [ ] Different search strategies compared and contrasted
- [ ] Educational search recipes created and tested

## ü§î Common Questions

**Q: When should I use `graphiti.search()` vs `graphiti._search()`?**
A: Use `graphiti.search()` for most cases. Use `graphiti._search()` when you need fine-grained control over search configuration.

**Q: How do I choose the right search recipe?**
A: Choose based on what you want to find: `NODE_*` for entities, `EDGE_*` for relationships, `COMBINED_*` for comprehensive results.

**Q: What's the difference between semantic and keyword search?**
A: Semantic search understands meaning and context, while keyword search matches exact terms. Hybrid search combines both.

**Q: How does node distance reranking work?**
A: It prioritizes results based on graph proximity to a focal node, making results more relevant to that specific entity.

## üìù What You Learned

‚úÖ **Hybrid Search Mastery**: Combined semantic similarity and BM25 retrieval for comprehensive results
‚úÖ **Node Distance Reranking**: Focused search results around specific entities
‚úÖ **Configurable Search**: Used search recipes for precise control over result types
‚úÖ **Reranking Strategies**: Applied RRF, MMR, and Cross-Encoder for result optimization
‚úÖ **Educational Search Patterns**: Created domain-specific search recipes for learning scenarios

## üéØ Next Steps

**Outstanding work!** You now master the art of finding exactly what you need in complex educational knowledge graphs.

**Ready to manipulate your knowledge graph directly?** Continue to **[07_crud_operations](../07_crud_operations/)** where you'll learn to create, read, update, and delete nodes and edges with surgical precision.

**What's Coming**: Instead of just searching for information, you'll learn to directly modify your knowledge graph for precise maintenance and integration with external systems!

---

**Key Takeaway**: Search is not just about finding information‚Äîit's about discovering insights. Different search strategies reveal different aspects of the learning process. Master all approaches to unlock your knowledge graph's full potential! üîç
