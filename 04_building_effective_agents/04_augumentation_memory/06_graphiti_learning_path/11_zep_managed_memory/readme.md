# Step 11: [Zep Memory Architecture](https://help.getzep.com/concepts) - Production Memory Systems

Understand how Graphiti powers Zep's production memory architecture for AI agents. Zep is layer to manage knowledge graphs you have to implement memory on top of it. 

Zep have already done this for you. Purpose of this step is to explore zep so you can use it when needed and take it as reference for your agent memory and graph rag needs.

## üìö Core Concepts

### Zep's Memory Architecture

**Zep** is a production memory service built on Graphiti that provides:

**Memory Types:**
- **User Memory**: Personal context and preferences
- **Session Memory**: Conversation-specific context
- **Group Memory**: Shared knowledge across users
- **Fact Memory**: Structured knowledge and relationships

**Educational Applications:**
- **Student Memory**: Individual learning history and preferences
- **Class Memory**: Shared course knowledge and discussions
- **Institutional Memory**: Curriculum and pedagogical knowledge
- **Assessment Memory**: Performance patterns and insights

### Memory Lifecycle in Zep

```python
# Zep Memory Lifecycle (Educational Context)
1. Memory Ingestion
   - Student interactions ‚Üí Episodes
   - Assessment results ‚Üí Facts
   - Course content ‚Üí Structured knowledge

2. Memory Processing  
   - Entity extraction (students, concepts, skills)
   - Relationship discovery (learning progressions)
   - Community detection (study groups, concept clusters)

3. Memory Retrieval
   - Contextual search for personalized tutoring
   - Historical analysis for learning analytics
   - Predictive insights for intervention

4. Memory Management
   - Privacy boundaries (FERPA compliance)
   - Retention policies (academic records)
   - Performance optimization
```

## üéØ Next Steps

Continue to **[12_tutorsgpt_implementation](../12_tutorsgpt_implementation/)** for the capstone project integrating all Graphiti concepts.

**Master's Tip**: Zep shows how Graphiti scales to production AI memory systems. Study their patterns to build robust educational memory architectures that can handle real-world complexity! üèóÔ∏è
