## 🏗️ **Architecture Highlights**

### **Multi-User Namespacing (Step 05)**
```python
# Each student gets isolated memory space
namespace = f"student_{student_id}_{course}_{semester}"
# Example: "student_alice_123_cs101_fall2024"
```

### **Educational Domain Types (Step 03)**
```python
class Student(BaseModel):
    student_id: str
    learning_style: str  # Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic
    current_level: str   # Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
    # ... rich educational metadata

class TutoringContext(BaseModel):
    learning_history: List[Dict]
    recent_struggles: List[str]
    recommended_approach: str
    # ... context for AI tutoring
```

### **Fact Triple Integration (Step 08)**
```python
# Structured educational relationships
(Alice, MASTERED, Variables) → (Variables, PREREQUISITE_FOR, Loops)
(Alice, COMPLETED, Python_Quiz) → (Python_Quiz, ASSESSES, Programming_Fundamentals)
```

### **Intelligent Search (Step 06)**
```python
# Context-aware educational queries
await graphiti.search(
    query="student alice learning experience python loops",
    group_id="student_alice_123_cs101_fall2024",
    limit=10
)
```

## 📊 **Real-World Usage Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: AI Tutor Integration**
```python
# AI tutor gets rich context about student
context = await get_tutoring_context("alice_123", "python_loops")

# Context includes:
# - Alice prefers visual explanations
# - She mastered variables but struggled with conditionals  
# - Recommended approach: "Use step-by-step visual examples"
```

### **Scenario 2: Learning Progress Dashboard**
```python
# Generate comprehensive learning insights
insights = await get_learning_insights("alice_123", "last_30_days")

# Returns:
# - Concepts mastered: 5
# - Learning velocity: 2.1 concepts/week
# - Strength areas: ["Visual learning", "Hands-on practice"]
# - Recommendations: ["Continue visual approach", "Add abstract practice"]
```

### **Scenario 3: Adaptive Learning System**
```python
# Check if student is ready for advanced topics
readiness = await get_learning_readiness("alice_123", "Functions,Classes,Inheritance")

# Returns readiness scores and prerequisite analysis
# Enables adaptive curriculum sequencing
```
