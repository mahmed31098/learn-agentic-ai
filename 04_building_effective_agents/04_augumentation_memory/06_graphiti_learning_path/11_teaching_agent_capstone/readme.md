# Step 09: TutorsGPT Memory MCP Server - AI-Powered Educational Memory

Now that you've mastered all Graphiti fundamentals, let's build the ultimate educational memory system: a **comprehensive MCP server** that leverages everything you've learned to create intelligent tutoring experiences.

## üß† **What We're Building**

A **TutorsGPT Memory MCP Server** that combines:
- ‚úÖ **Episodes** for natural learning conversations
- ‚úÖ **Custom Types** for educational domain modeling
- ‚úÖ **Communities** for knowledge clustering  
- ‚úÖ **Namespacing** for multi-user isolation
- ‚úÖ **Search** for intelligent retrieval
- ‚úÖ **CRUD** for precise data management
- ‚úÖ **Fact Triples** for structured relationships

## üéØ **Why This Matters**

After implementing Steps 01-10, you now understand that building educational AI requires:

1. **Multi-User Memory**: Each student needs isolated learning history
2. **Context Engineering**: AI tutors need rich context about student progress
3. **Learning Analytics**: Track mastery, struggles, and progress patterns
4. **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggest next learning steps based on history
5. **Intelligent Tutoring**: Adapt explanations based on student's learning journey

## üîç **Learning from Our Journey**

### **What We Discovered**

Through implementing Steps 01-10, we learned that effective educational memory needs:

```python
# From Step 02: Episodes for natural learning content
"Alice struggled with loops but finally understood them through visual examples"

# From Step 03: Custom types for educational structure  
Student(learning_style="Visual", mastery_level="Intermediate")

# From Step 04: Communities for knowledge organization
Programming_Concepts = ["Variables", "Loops", "Functions"]

# From Step 05: Namespacing for multi-user systems
group_id = "student_alice_cs101_fall2024"

# From Step 06: Search for intelligent retrieval
"Show me Alice's progress with programming concepts"

# From Step 07: CRUD for precise updates
alice.attributes["mastery_score"] = 85

# From Step 08: Fact triples for structured knowledge
(Alice, MASTERED, Variables) ‚Üí (Variables, PREREQUISITE_FOR, Loops)
```

### **The Missing Piece: MCP Integration**

Your existing MCP server in `@05_mcp_temporal_memory/` is generic. Now we'll create an **educational-specific MCP server** that:

- Uses **educational custom types** from Step 03
- Implements **student namespacing** from Step 05  
- Provides **learning analytics tools** using search from Step 06
- Offers **tutoring context engineering** combining all techniques

## üöÄ **TutorsGPT Memory MCP Server Architecture**

async def create_student_profile(
    student_id: str,
    name: str, 
    learning_style: str,
    grade_level: str,
    subjects: List[str]
) -> str:
    """Create a new student profile with educational metadata"""
    
@mcp.tool()
async def get_student_profile(student_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Retrieve comprehensive student profile and learning history"""
```

### **2. Learning Session Tools**

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def start_learning_session(
    student_id: str,
    topic: str,
    session_type: str = "tutorial"
) -> str:
    """Begin a new learning session with context preparation"""
    
@mcp.tool()
async def end_learning_session(
    session_id: str,
    mastery_achieved: bool,
    difficulty_rating: int,
    notes: str
) -> str:
    """Complete learning session and update student progress"""
```

### **3. Context Engineering Tools**

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def get_tutoring_context(
    student_id: str,
    current_topic: str,
    context_depth: str = "full"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get rich context for AI tutoring including:
    - Student's learning history with this topic
    - Previous struggles and successes  
    - Learning style preferences
    - Prerequisite knowledge status
    - Recommended explanation approach
    """

@mcp.tool()
async def analyze_learning_gaps(
    student_id: str,
    target_concept: str
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Identify knowledge gaps preventing mastery of target concept"""
```

### **4. Learning Analytics Tools**

async def get_learning_insights(
    student_id: str,
    time_period: str = "last_30_days"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Generate learning analytics and insights"""
    
@mcp.tool()
async def track_concept_mastery(
    student_id: str,
    concept: str,
    assessment_score: int,
    assessment_type: str
) -> str:
    """Record concept mastery progress"""
```

### **5. Personalized Recommendation Tools**

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def recommend_next_topics(
    student_id: str,
    current_subject: str,
    difficulty_preference: str = "adaptive"
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Suggest next learning topics based on student progress"""
    
@mcp.tool()
async def suggest_learning_resources(
    student_id: str,
    topic: str,
    resource_types: List[str] = ["video", "practice", "reading"]
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Recommend learning resources matched to student's learning style"""
```

## üéì **Real-World Usage Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: AI Tutor Session**

```python
# AI Tutor starts session with Alice
context = await get_tutoring_context("alice_123", "python_loops")

# Context includes:
# - Alice prefers visual explanations
# - She struggled with variables last week but mastered them
# - She learns best with concrete examples
# - She's ready for loops (prerequisites met)

# AI Tutor adapts explanation based on context
```

### **Scenario 2: Learning Progress Tracking**

```python
# After Alice completes a loops assessment
await track_concept_mastery(
    student_id="alice_123",
    concept="python_loops", 
    assessment_score=85,
    assessment_type="coding_practice"
)

# System automatically:
# - Updates Alice's mastery profile
# - Identifies she's ready for functions
# - Suggests next learning path
```

### **Scenario 3: Personalized Recommendations**

```python
# Get recommendations for Alice's next learning
recommendations = await recommend_next_topics("alice_123", "programming")

# Returns:
# - Functions (prerequisite: loops ‚úÖ)
# - List comprehensions (prerequisite: loops ‚úÖ, functions ‚ùå)
# - Suggested focus: Functions first
```

## üîß **Implementation Architecture**

### **Multi-User Namespacing (from Step 05)**
```python
# Each student gets isolated memory space
student_namespace = f"student_{student_id}_{course_id}_{semester}"
group_id = student_namespace
```

### **Educational Custom Types (from Step 03)**
```python
# Rich educational domain modeling
class LearningEvent(BaseModel):
    event_type: str  # "struggle", "breakthrough", "mastery", "confusion"
    concept: str
    timestamp: datetime
    context: str
    emotional_state: str
```

### **Intelligent Search (from Step 06)**
```python
# Context-aware educational search
async def search_learning_history(student_id: str, concept: str):
    return await graphiti.search(
        query=f"student {student_id} learning experience {concept}",
        group_id=f"student_{student_id}",
        search_type="hybrid"
    )
```

## üìà **Benefits of This Approach**

1. **Personalized Learning**: Each student gets AI tutoring adapted to their unique learning journey
2. **Context-Aware AI**: Tutors understand student history, struggles, and preferences  
3. **Learning Analytics**: Track patterns, identify gaps, measure progress
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Multi-user system with proper isolation
5. **Rich Memory**: Combines structured data (fact triples) with natural language (episodes)
