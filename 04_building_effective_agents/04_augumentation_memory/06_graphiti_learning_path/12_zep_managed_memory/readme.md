# Step 12: [Zep Memory Architecture](https://help.getzep.com/concepts) - Production Memory Systems

Understand how Graphiti powers Zep's production memory architecture for AI agents. Zep is layer to manage knowledge graphs you have to implement memory on top of it. 

## What is Zep?

Zep is a closed-source ‚Äúcontext engineering‚Äù platform that uses the open-source Graphiti engine to build a dynamic temporal knowledge graph from every conversation, user interaction, and business data stream. Zep explicitly supports agent memory and Graph RAG use cases: it ‚Äúdelivers structured, LLM-ready context‚Äù including user preferences and business facts and offers ‚ÄúGraph RAG for dynamic data‚Äù that answers queries over the temporal graph in milliseconds

- In benchmarks (Deep Memory Retrieval and LongMemEval), Zep outperformed MemGPT (Letta) by large margins ‚Äì e.g. up to ~100% relative accuracy gains on multi-turn conversational reasoning and 90% latency reduction versus naively loading full chat logs.
- Being a proprietary SaaS, Zep is closed-source (Graphiti itself is Apache‚Äë2.0 open-source) and deployed as a hosted platform. It integrates with enterprise stacks (Neo4j or FalkorDB backends, LangGraph for memory persistence, etc.) and emphasizes business readiness (e.g. customer-authentication, RBAC, HIPAA-compliance likely supported via its cloud service)

## üìö Core Concepts

### Zep's Memory Architecture

**Zep** is a production memory service built on Graphiti that provides:

**Memory Types:**
- **User Memory**: Personal context and preferences
- **Session Memory**: Conversation-specific context
- **Group Memory**: Shared knowledge across users
- **Fact Memory**: Structured knowledge and relationships

**Educational Applications:**
- **Student Memory**: Individual learning history and preferences
- **Class Memory**: Shared course knowledge and discussions
- **Institutional Memory**: Curriculum and pedagogical knowledge
- **Assessment Memory**: Performance patterns and insights

### Memory Lifecycle in Zep

```python
# Zep Memory Lifecycle (Educational Context)
1. Memory Ingestion
   - Student interactions ‚Üí Episodes
   - Assessment results ‚Üí Facts
   - Course content ‚Üí Structured knowledge

2. Memory Processing  
   - Entity extraction (students, concepts, skills)
   - Relationship discovery (learning progressions)
   - Community detection (study groups, concept clusters)

3. Memory Retrieval
   - Contextual search for personalized tutoring
   - Historical analysis for learning analytics
   - Predictive insights for intervention

4. Memory Management
   - Privacy boundaries (FERPA compliance)
   - Retention policies (academic records)
   - Performance optimization
