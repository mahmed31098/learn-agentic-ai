# Step 02: Adding Episodes - The Three Data Types

Now that you've created your first Graphiti program, let's master episodes - the foundation of how Graphiti ingests and processes information.

## üìö Official Documentation

- [Adding Episodes](https://help.getzep.com/graphiti/core-concepts/adding-episodes) - Complete guide to episode types
- [Episode Types](https://help.getzep.com/graphiti/core-concepts/episodes) - Detailed episode concepts
- [Temporal Data](https://help.getzep.com/graphiti/core-concepts/temporal-data) - Time-aware knowledge graphs

## üéØ What You'll Learn

By the end of this step, you will:
- Master the three episode types: `text`, `message`, and `json`
- Understand exactly when to use each type for different educational scenarios
- Handle bulk episode loading for performance
- See how episodes become searchable knowledge through LLM processing

## üìã Prerequisites

- Completed Step 01 (Hello World)
- Graphiti client working with basic search
- Understanding of async Python programming

## üìö What are Episodes?

### The Core Concept

**Episodes** are the primary way Graphiti ingests information. Think of an episode as a single "event" or "piece of information" that happened at a specific time.

**Key Properties:**
- **Episodes are nodes themselves** - they become part of your knowledge graph
- **Temporal tracking** - every episode has a `reference_time` 
- **Provenance** - you can trace where any extracted knowledge came from
- **LLM processing** - episodes are analyzed to extract entities and relationships

### How Episodes Work

1. **You add an episode** ‚Üí Raw information goes into Graphiti
2. **LLM processes the episode** ‚Üí Extracts entities (people, concepts, things) and relationships
3. **Knowledge graph grows** ‚Üí New nodes and edges are created
4. **Everything stays connected** ‚Üí Extracted entities link back to the original episode via `MENTIONS` edges

### The Three Episode Types

Graphiti supports three episode types, each optimized for different data structures:

## üìù **Text Episodes** - For Narrative Content

**Use for:** Stories, descriptions, reports, articles, learning content, student reflections

**Best for:** Unstructured narrative content that needs entity extraction

```python
await graphiti.add_episode(
    name="student_background",
    episode_body=(
        "Alice Chen is a 22-year-old biology student who enrolled in Python 101. "
        "She has excellent analytical skills from her science background but has "
        "never programmed before. Alice wants to learn Python to analyze DNA "
        "sequences and biological data for her research."
    ),
    source=EpisodeType.text,
    source_description="Student enrollment system",
    reference_time=datetime.now()
)
```

**What Graphiti extracts:**
- Entities: `Alice Chen`, `Python 101`, `biology`, `DNA sequences`
- Relationships: `Alice ENROLLED_IN Python 101`, `Alice STUDIES biology`
- Temporal context: When this information was recorded

## üí¨ **Message Episodes** - For Conversations

**Use for:** Dialogues, chats, tutoring sessions, interviews, Q&A sessions

**Format requirement:** Use `Speaker: Message` pattern - this is crucial!

```python
await graphiti.add_episode(
    name="tutoring_session",
    episode_body=(
        "Student: I don't understand Python loops\n"
        "Tutor: Let's start with a simple example. What do you want to repeat?\n"
        "Student: I want to count DNA bases in a sequence\n"
        "Tutor: Perfect! A for loop is ideal for that task\n"
        "Student: Can you show me the syntax?\n"
        "Tutor: Sure! for base in dna_sequence:"
    ),
    source=EpisodeType.message,
    source_description="Online tutoring platform",
    reference_time=datetime.now()
)
```

**What Graphiti extracts:**
- Participants: `Student`, `Tutor` 
- Topics discussed: `Python loops`, `DNA bases`, `for loop syntax`
- Learning progression: Student confusion ‚Üí tutor guidance ‚Üí understanding
- Conversation flow and educational interactions

## üìä **JSON Episodes** - For Structured Data

**Use for:** Database records, API responses, assessment results, structured system data

**Best for:** When you already have structured data and want precise control

```python
assessment_data = {
    "student_id": "alice_chen_001",
    "student_name": "Alice Chen",
    "course": "Python 101",
    "assessment_type": "loops_quiz",
    "date": "2024-01-15",
    "score": 88,
    "max_score": 100,
    "time_spent_minutes": 35,
    "questions_correct": 7,
    "questions_total": 8,
    "topics_tested": ["for_loops", "while_loops", "nested_loops"],
    "strengths": ["basic_loop_syntax", "iteration_logic"],
    "needs_improvement": ["nested_loop_complexity"],
    "instructor_notes": "Great progress! Ready for functions next."
}

await graphiti.add_episode(
    name="alice_loops_assessment",
    episode_body=assessment_data,
    source=EpisodeType.json,
    source_description="Learning management system",
    reference_time=datetime.now()
)
```

**What Graphiti extracts:**
- Structured relationships: `Alice SCORED 88 ON loops_quiz`
- Performance metrics: scores, timing, topic mastery
- Learning insights: strengths and improvement areas
- Temporal progression: assessment timeline

## üöÄ Complete Working Example

Let's build a comprehensive educational scenario using all three episode types:

### episodes_demo.py

[The existing episodes_demo.py file content remains the same - it's already well-structured]

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Example

1. **Save the code** as `episodes_demo.py`
2. **Make sure your environment** from Step 01 is working
3. **Run the program**:

```bash
uv run python episodes_demo.py
```

## üß™ Try It Yourself

### Exercise 1: Add More Episode Types

Create episodes for different educational scenarios:

```python
# Research project discussion (text episode)
await graphiti.add_episode(
    name="research_project_discussion",
    episode_body=(
        "The Advanced Biology Research Project requires students to analyze "
        "real genomic data using Python. Teams of 2-3 students will choose "
        "from datasets on cancer genetics, evolutionary biology, or "
        "microbial genomics. The project spans 8 weeks and includes "
        "data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization."
    ),
    source=EpisodeType.text,
    reference_time=datetime.now()
)

# Study group conversation (message episode)
await graphiti.add_episode(
    name="study_group_session",
    episode_body=(
        "Alice: I'm working on the genomic analysis project\n"
        "Bob: Which dataset did you choose?\n"
        "Alice: Cancer genetics - it's challenging but fascinating\n"
        "Carol: I can help with the statistical analysis part\n"
        "Alice: That would be amazing! I'm struggling with p-values\n"
        "Bob: Let's meet tomorrow to work through it together"
    ),
    source=EpisodeType.message,
    reference_time=datetime.now()
)

# Assignment submission data (JSON episode)
submission_data = {
    "assignment_id": "genomic_analysis_001",
    "student_id": "alice_chen_001",
    "submission_date": "2024-02-15",
    "files_submitted": ["analysis.py", "visualization.ipynb", "report.pdf"],
    "dataset_used": "cancer_genetics_tcga",
    "code_quality_score": 92,
    "analysis_accuracy": 87,
    "collaboration_partners": ["bob_martinez", "carol_zhang"],
    "instructor_feedback": "Excellent statistical approach, visualization needs improvement"
}

await graphiti.add_episode(
    name="alice_project_submission",
    episode_body=submission_data,
    source=EpisodeType.json,
    reference_time=datetime.now()
)
```

### Exercise 2: Understanding Episode Processing

Add episodes and then search to see what was extracted:

```python
# Add an episode
await graphiti.add_episode(
    name="debugging_session",
    episode_body="Alice spent 45 minutes debugging a Python function that calculates GC content in DNA sequences. The issue was an off-by-one error in the loop indexing.",
    source=EpisodeType.text,
    reference_time=datetime.now()
)

# Search to see what was extracted
results = await graphiti.search("Alice debugging Python DNA GC content")
for result in results:
    print(f"Extracted: {result.fact}")
```

## ‚ö° Bulk Episode Loading

For efficiency with large datasets, use bulk loading:

### bulk_loading_demo.py

```python
from graphiti_core.nodes import RawEpisode
import json

async def bulk_loading_demo():
    """Efficiently load multiple episodes"""
    
    # Same Graphiti setup as main demo
    graphiti = Graphiti(...)  # Your configuration here
    
    try:
        print("‚ö° Starting Bulk Loading Demo...")
        
        # Prepare multiple episodes efficiently
        episodes = []
        
        # Simulate importing student assessment data
        for student_id in range(1, 11):  # 10 students
            for week in range(1, 5):  # 4 weeks of assessments
                assessment = {
                    "student_id": f"student_{student_id:03d}",
                    "week": week,
                    "topic": f"Python Week {week}",
                    "quiz_score": 70 + (student_id * 2) + (week * 3),  # Varied scores
                    "assignment_score": 75 + (student_id * 1.5) + (week * 2),
                    "participation": "High" if student_id % 2 == 0 else "Medium",
                    "submission_date": f"2024-01-{week*7:02d}"
                }
                
                episodes.append(RawEpisode(
                    name=f"assessment_s{student_id:03d}_w{week}",
                    content=json.dumps(assessment),
                    source=EpisodeType.json,
                    source_description="Bulk assessment import",
                    reference_time=datetime.now() - timedelta(weeks=4-week)
                ))
        
        # Bulk load all episodes (much faster than individual calls)
        print(f"üì¶ Bulk loading {len(episodes)} assessment episodes...")
        await graphiti.add_episode_bulk(episodes)
        
        print(f"‚úÖ Successfully imported {len(episodes)} episodes")
        
        # Verify the bulk import worked
        print("\nüîç Searching bulk imported data...")
        search_results = await graphiti.search(
            query="student assessment quiz scores participation week",
            num_results=15
        )
        
        print(f"Found {len(search_results)} results from bulk import:")
        for i, result in enumerate(search_results[:8], 1):
            print(f"  {i}. {result.fact}")
            
    finally:
        await graphiti.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(bulk_loading_demo())
```

## üéØ Decision Guide: When to Use Each Episode Type

| Your Data | Episode Type | Why | Example |
|-----------|--------------|-----|---------|
| Student essay, reflection, or narrative description | `text` | Rich context needs entity extraction | "Alice reflected on her learning journey..." |
| Tutoring conversation, class discussion, Q&A | `message` | Preserves speaker relationships and dialogue flow | "Student: I'm confused\nTutor: Let me help" |
| Grade records, assessment results, structured logs | `json` | Precise data structure, no ambiguity needed | `{"student": "Alice", "score": 95}` |
| Mixed content (narrative + data) | `text` | Convert structured parts to narrative | "Alice scored 95% and felt confident about..." |
| Email or forum posts | `text` or `message` | Depends on format - if speaker:message format, use `message` | Choose based on structure |

## üîç **How Episodes Become Knowledge**

### The Processing Pipeline

1. **Episode Creation** ‚Üí You add raw information
2. **LLM Analysis** ‚Üí Graphiti's LLM extracts entities and relationships  
3. **Knowledge Graph Update** ‚Üí New nodes and edges are created
4. **Searchable Knowledge** ‚Üí Information becomes queryable and discoverable

### Example: Text Episode Processing

**Input episode:**
```
"Alice Chen scored 92% on her Python loops quiz and is ready to move on to functions."
```

**What Graphiti extracts:**
- **Entities**: `Alice Chen`, `Python loops quiz`, `functions`, `92%`
- **Relationships**: `Alice SCORED 92% ON Python loops quiz`, `Alice READY_FOR functions`
- **Temporal context**: When this achievement occurred
- **Provenance**: Links back to the original episode

### Search Power

After processing, you can search for:
- `"Alice performance"` ‚Üí Finds her quiz results
- `"students ready for functions"` ‚Üí Identifies students at that level
- `"Python loops assessments"` ‚Üí Shows all loop-related evaluations
- `"92 percent scores"` ‚Üí Finds high-performing students

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [ ] All three episode types added successfully
- [ ] Search returns results from different episode types
- [ ] Message episodes preserve speaker relationships
- [ ] JSON episodes capture structured data precisely
- [ ] Temporal progression visible in search results
- [ ] Bulk loading working for multiple episodes

## ü§î Common Questions

**Q: Can I mix episode types for the same event?**
A: Yes! You might have a text episode describing a tutoring session and a JSON episode with the structured assessment data from that session.

**Q: What if my conversation doesn't follow "Speaker: Message" format?**
A: Convert it to that format for message episodes, or use a text episode and describe the conversation narratively.

**Q: How do I know if my JSON is too complex?**
A: If you get context window errors, break large JSON objects into smaller, focused episodes representing specific aspects.

**Q: Should I use text or JSON for grades?**
A: Use JSON for pure data (scores, dates, IDs) and text when you want to capture context ("Alice improved dramatically after struggling initially").

## üìù What You Learned

‚úÖ **Episode Fundamentals**: Episodes are nodes that become part of your knowledge graph
‚úÖ **Three Episode Types**: Text (narrative), Message (conversations), JSON (structured data)  
‚úÖ **LLM Processing**: How episodes are analyzed to extract entities and relationships
‚úÖ **Temporal Tracking**: Every episode has a time context for historical analysis
‚úÖ **Search Integration**: How different episode types contribute to searchable knowledge
‚úÖ **Bulk Loading**: Efficient techniques for importing large datasets
‚úÖ **Decision Framework**: Clear rules for choosing the right episode type

## üéØ Next Steps

**Excellent work!** You now understand how to feed different types of data into Graphiti and how that data becomes searchable knowledge.

**Ready for more precision?** Continue to **[03_custom_types](../03_custom_types/)** where you'll learn to define custom entities and relationships like `Student`, `Course`, and `ENROLLED_IN` instead of generic nodes and edges.

**What's Coming**: Transform your knowledge graphs from generic entities to domain-specific, meaningful structures that understand your educational context!

---

**Key Takeaway**: Episodes are the foundation of your knowledge graph. Choose the right episode type based on data structure, not content domain. A math conversation is still a `message` episode, and a math test result is still `json`! üéØ

*"The right episode type makes your knowledge graph more accurate and searchable - think structure, not content!"*
