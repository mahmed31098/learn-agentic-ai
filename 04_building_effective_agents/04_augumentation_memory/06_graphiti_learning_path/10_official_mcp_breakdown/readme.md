# Step 10: Official Graphiti MCP Server Breakdown - Understanding Before Building (Discussion + Project)

> For implementation see the last step 05_temporal_kg_mcp_server before graphiti learning path.

Before diving into building custom educational systems, let's understand how the **official Graphiti MCP server** works. This step breaks down the existing server so you understand the foundations before creating specialized implementations.

## üéØ **Why This Matters**

You've learned all the Graphiti fundamentals (Steps 01-08), but the **official MCP server** is your first look at how these concepts work together in a production system. Understanding this architecture will help you:

- **Recognize patterns** used in real-world Graphiti applications
- **Understand best practices** for MCP server development
- **Learn from proven architecture** before building custom solutions
- **Appreciate the complexity** that Graphiti abstracts for you

## üìÅ **Official MCP Server Structure**

The official server lives in `@05_mcp_temporal_memory/graphiti_mcp_server/` and follows this structure:

```
graphiti_mcp_server/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp_server.py          # Main server with all tools (981 lines!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ python_client.py       # Demo client for testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ postman.json          # Postman collection for API testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # Setup and usage instructions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                  # Environment configuration
```

## üîß **Server Architecture Breakdown**

### **1. Core Imports and Setup**

```python
# Essential MCP and Graphiti imports
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.nodes import EpisodeType, EpisodicNode
from graphiti_core.edges import EntityEdge

# Gemini LLM integration (not OpenAI!)
from graphiti_core.llm_client.gemini_client import GeminiClient
from graphiti_core.embedder.gemini import GeminiEmbedder
```

**Key Insight**: The official server uses **Gemini** (Google) instead of OpenAI, showing Graphiti's LLM flexibility.

### **2. Configuration Management**

```python
# Environment-based configuration
DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL = os.getenv('MODEL_NAME', 'gemini-2.5-flash')
SMALL_LLM_MODEL = os.getenv('SMALL_LLM_MODEL', 'gemini-2.5-flash')
DEFAULT_EMBEDDER_MODEL = os.getenv('DEFAULT_EMBEDDER_MODEL', 'embedding-001')

# Rate limiting for production
SEMAPHORE_LIMIT = int(os.getenv('SEMAPHORE_LIMIT', 10))
```

**Key Insight**: Production servers need **rate limiting** and **environment-based configuration** for different deployment scenarios.

### **3. Custom Domain Types**

The server includes **business-focused** custom types:

```python
class Requirement(BaseModel):
    """Requirements for projects and products"""
    project_name: str
    description: str

class Preference(BaseModel):
    """User preferences and likes/dislikes"""
    category: str  # 'Brands', 'Food', 'Music'
    description: str

class Procedure(BaseModel):
    """Step-by-step procedures and workflows"""
    # ... detailed procedure modeling
```

**Key Insight**: The official server targets **business and enterprise use cases**, not education. This shows how custom types should match your domain.

### **4. MCP Server Instructions**

```python
GRAPHITI_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Graphiti is a memory service for AI agents built on a knowledge graph. 
Graphiti performs well with dynamic data such as user interactions, 
changing enterprise data, and external information.

Key capabilities:
1. Add episodes (text, messages, or JSON) to the knowledge graph
2. Search for nodes (entities) using natural language queries
3. Find relevant facts (relationships between entities)
4. Retrieve specific entity edges or episodes by UUID
5. Manage the knowledge graph with maintenance tools
"""
```

**Key Insight**: Clear **server instructions** help AI assistants understand how to use the tools effectively.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Official MCP Tools Analysis**

- **Rebuilds indices** for fresh start
- **Development and testing** tool - dangerous in production!

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Patterns**

### **1. Background Processing with Queues**

```python
# Episode processing queue per group_id
episode_queues: dict[str, asyncio.Queue] = {}
queue_workers: dict[str, bool] = {}

async def process_episode_queue(group_id: str):
    """Process episodes sequentially for each group"""
    while queue_workers.get(group_id, True):
        episode_data = await episode_queues[group_id].get()
        # Process episode...
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Scalability**: Handles multiple users simultaneously
- **Consistency**: Sequential processing prevents race conditions
- **Performance**: Non-blocking API responses

### **2. Error Handling Pattern**

```python
class SuccessResponse(BaseModel):
    success: bool = True
    message: str

class ErrorResponse(BaseModel):
    success: bool = False
    error: str

# Usage in tools
try:
    # ... operation
    return SuccessResponse(message="Operation completed")
except Exception as e:
    return ErrorResponse(error=str(e))
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Consistent responses**: All tools return similar structure
- **Error transparency**: Clear error messages for debugging
- **Type safety**: Pydantic models ensure structure

### **3. Multi-Tenant Isolation**

```python
# Every operation respects group_id
async def add_memory(group_id: str | None = None, ...):
    if group_id is None:
        group_id = config.default_group_id
    # ... use group_id for isolation
```

**Architecture benefit:**
- **Data separation**: Multiple users/projects isolated
- **Scalable design**: Single server, multiple tenants

## üß† **Extending to Complete Agentic Memory System**

The official MCP server provides the **foundation** for implementing all memory types from cognitive science. Here's how it could be extended to create a **comprehensive multi-user agentic memory system**:

### **Current Implementation Mapping**

The official server already implements several memory types:

| Memory Type | Current Implementation | How It Works |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Long-Term Memory** | `add_memory` + persistent storage | Episodes stored in Neo4j, persist across sessions |
| **Episodic Memory** | Episodes with timestamps | Each episode is a specific event with temporal context |
| **Semantic Memory** | Entity extraction + fact triples | LLM extracts structured knowledge from episodes |

### **Missing Memory Types & Extensions**

To create a **complete agentic memory system**, we could extend the official server:

#### **1. Short-Term Memory (STM) Extension**

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def manage_working_memory(
    user_id: str,
    operation: str,  # "add", "get", "clear", "summarize"
    content: str = "",
    context_window: int = 10
) -> WorkingMemoryResponse:
    """Manage agent's working memory/scratchpad for current session
    
    STM serves as the agent's 'conscious mind' - a dynamic workspace for:
    - Planning and reasoning traces
    - Current task state management  
    - Multi-step problem solving
    - Error correction and adaptation
    """
    
    # Implementation would use in-memory storage with TTL
    # Could integrate with agent's current reasoning trace
```

#### **2. Procedural Memory Extension**

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def manage_procedures(
    user_id: str,
    operation: str,  # "learn", "execute", "update", "list"
    procedure_name: str = "",
    steps: List[str] = [],
    success_rate: float = 0.0
) -> ProceduralMemoryResponse:
    """Manage learned procedures and skill sequences
    
    Procedural memory stores 'how to' knowledge:
    - Learned task sequences (e.g., "how to debug code")
    - Skill patterns (e.g., "how to write tests")  
    - Tool usage workflows (e.g., "how to deploy apps")
    - Decision rules (e.g., "when to use which approach")
    """
    
    # Could store as structured workflows in knowledge graph
    # Track success rates and optimize over time
```

#### **3. Reflection Memory Extension**

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def manage_reflections(
    user_id: str,
    operation: str,  # "reflect", "get_insights", "track_patterns"
    task_outcome: str = "",
    reflection_type: str = "performance",  # "performance", "learning", "error"
    insights: List[str] = []
) -> ReflectionResponse:
    """Manage agent's self-reflection and meta-learning
    
    Reflection enables agents to:
    - Analyze their own performance patterns
    - Learn from mistakes and successes
    - Identify improvement opportunities
    - Adapt strategies based on outcomes
    """
    
    # Could analyze episode patterns to generate insights
    # Track performance trends over time
```

#### **4. Enhanced Multi-User Memory Management**

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def manage_user_memory_profile(
    user_id: str,
    operation: str,  # "create", "get", "update", "analyze"
    memory_preferences: Dict[str, Any] = {},
    learning_patterns: Dict[str, Any] = {}
) -> UserMemoryProfile:
    """Manage individual user memory profiles and preferences
    
    Each user gets personalized memory management:
    - Memory retention preferences (what to remember/forget)
    - Learning style adaptations
    - Context switching patterns
    - Memory consolidation schedules
    """
    
    # Sophisticated user modeling for memory optimization
```

### **Complete Agentic Memory Architecture**

```python
class ComprehensiveMemorySystem:
    """Extended official MCP server with full memory capabilities"""
    
    # Existing official tools (enhanced)
    add_memory()           # Episodes ‚Üí Long-term & Episodic memory
    search_memory_nodes()  # Semantic memory retrieval
    search_memory_facts()  # Relationship memory
    get_episodes()         # Recent episodic memory
    
    # New memory type extensions
    manage_working_memory()    # Short-term memory & reasoning traces
    manage_procedures()        # Procedural memory & learned skills
    manage_reflections()       # Meta-learning & self-improvement
    manage_user_profiles()     # Personalized memory management
    
    # Advanced memory operations
    consolidate_memories()     # Move STM ‚Üí LTM, strengthen important memories
    forget_memories()          # Selective forgetting & memory cleanup
    transfer_learning()        # Apply learned patterns to new domains
    memory_visualization()     # Understand memory structure & patterns
```

### **Real-World Applications**

This **comprehensive memory system** would enable:

#### **1. Advanced Personal AI Assistants**
