# Agentic Web

The **Agentic Web** is a paradigm shift in web architecture where autonomous AI agents, powered by advanced language models (LLMs), act as intermediaries to perform complex, goal-directed tasks on behalf of users. Unlike traditional web interactions, which involve human-driven browsing, searching, and manual task execution, the Agentic Web enables intelligent agents to reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks across diverse web services and platforms. This concept is detailed in the document *Agentic Web: Weaving the Next Web with AI Agents* (arXiv:2507.21206v1).

### Key Features of the Agentic Web:
1. **Autonomous Agents**:
   - Agents act as independent entities capable of understanding user intent, decomposing tasks, and orchestrating actions across web services.
   - They engage in long-term, goal-oriented interactions, moving beyond one-off, user-initiated requests to sustained, coordinated workflows.

2. **Core Functional Paradigms**:
   - **Transactional**: Agents execute tasks like e-commerce purchases, travel planning, or financial transactions autonomously, handling payments and negotiations.
   - **Informational**: Agents perform dynamic knowledge discovery, synthesizing information from multiple sources for tasks like research or analysis.
   - **Communicational**: Agents facilitate collaboration, forming coalitions to create content or coordinate between enterprises.

3. **Architectural Transformations**:
   - **Intelligence**: Agents leverage LLMs for contextual understanding, long-horizon planning, and adaptive learning, integrating multi-modal data (text, APIs, visuals).
   - **Interaction**: Shifts from static request-response models to proactive, semantic-driven interactions, using protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) for agent coordination.
   - **Economic**: Introduces the **Agent Attention Economy**, where services compete for agent invocation, with new monetization models based on task completion and capability relevance.

4. **Infrastructure Requirements**:
   - Standardized, machine-readable interfaces for web resources.
   - Semantic interoperability to enable agents to understand and align service capabilities.
   - Protocols like MCP and A2A to support agent discovery, communication, and task execution.

5. **Process Cycle** (as shown in Figure 1 of the document):
   - A user submits a task request.
   - The system plans the task, identifies relevant agents and tools, and recruits them.
   - Agents collaborate, execute tasks, and report results back to the user.

### Evolution from Previous Web Eras:
- **PC Web Era**: Focused on static pages, search engines, and manual browsing (e.g., PageRank for link-based ranking).
- **Mobile Web Era**: Emphasized personalized feeds and real-time recommendations, driven by user-generated content and mobile constraints.
- **Agentic Web Era**: Shifts to action-oriented, autonomous task execution, with agents acting as both users and interfaces, orchestrating services dynamically (see Figure 7 for architectural evolution).

### Example Applications:
- **E-commerce**: Agents autonomously handle product searches, price comparisons, and purchases.
- **Travel Planning**: Agents coordinate flights, accommodations, and itineraries based on user preferences (illustrated in Figure 11).
- **Enterprise Knowledge Assistants**: Agents manage data retrieval and collaboration across organizational systems.

### Challenges and Risks:
- **Safety and Security**: Autonomous agents introduce risks like context injection, service registry poisoning, and unauthorized transactions (Tables 4-7).
- **Governance**: Regulatory challenges arise from agents’ financial authority and cross-platform operations.
- **Economic Models**: The shift from ad-based revenue to agent-driven economies requires new billing frameworks, as traditional advertising is disrupted.

### Emerging Directions:
- **Agent-Oriented APIs**: APIs with semantic specifications to enable agent understanding and interaction.
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Techniques like AGrail and SudoLM for dynamic safety checks and credential-aware access control.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Developing trust and collaboration frameworks for agent ecosystems.

The Agentic Web represents a future where the web is not just a repository of information but a dynamic ecosystem of intelligent agents that act on behalf of users, transforming how digital tasks are performed and value is exchanged.

## Implementing Agentic Web

Implementing an Agentic Web using OpenAI’s Agents SDK, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols is feasible, as these tools and protocols are designed to enable autonomous, interoperable AI agents that can interact with tools, data, and other agents to perform complex tasks. Below, we outline how these components can be combined to create an Agentic Web system, based on their respective capabilities and the principles outlined in the *Agentic Web* paradigm (arXiv:2507.21206v1). I’ll also provide a practical approach, including code snippets where applicable, to demonstrate the implementation.

### Overview of Components
1. **OpenAI Agents SDK**:
   - A framework for building and orchestrating AI agents that can perform tasks autonomously, leveraging large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o.
   - Supports integration with external tools, multi-agent collaboration, and features like handoffs, guardrails, and observability.
   - Compatible with MCP for tool integration, enabling agents to access external data and services.[](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/openais-agents-sdk-and-anthropics-model-context-protocol-mcp)[](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/agents_sdk/multi-agent-portfolio-collaboration/multi_agent_portfolio_collaboration)

2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**:
   - An open standard by Anthropic (open-sourced November 2024) that standardizes how AI agents connect to external tools and data sources, acting like a “USB-C port for AI applications.”
   - Supports multiple transport mechanisms (stdio, HTTP over SSE, Streamable HTTP) and provides secure, typed data exchange via JSON-RPC.
   - Widely adopted by platforms like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Microsoft, with SDKs in Go, C#, Java, and Python.[](https://agnt.one/blog/the-model-context-protocol-for-ai-agents)[](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/)[](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)

3. **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol**:
   - Introduced by Google in April 2025, A2A enables peer-to-peer communication between AI agents across different frameworks and vendors.
   - Uses HTTP-based communication with JSON-RPC, Agent Cards (JSON descriptors for agent capabilities), and supports task delegation and long-running workflows.
   - Complements MCP by focusing on agent-to-agent collaboration rather than agent-to-tool integration.[](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/a2a)[](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/)

4. **Agentic Web**:
   - A vision where autonomous AI agents act as intermediaries, performing goal-directed tasks across web services, shifting from human-driven browsing to agent-driven workflows.
   - Requires standardized interfaces (MCP for tools, A2A for agent collaboration), semantic interoperability, and robust infrastructure for task planning and execution.

### Implementation Approach
To implement an Agentic Web system, you can use the OpenAI Agents SDK to orchestrate agents, MCP to connect agents to external tools and data, and A2A to enable agent-to-agent collaboration. Below is a step-by-step guide, including practical examples for a simplified use case (e.g., a travel planning agent that books flights and hotels).

#### Step 1: Set Up the OpenAI Agents SDK
The OpenAI Agents SDK simplifies agent creation and orchestration. You’ll need to install the SDK and configure it with your OpenAI API key. The SDK supports MCP servers for tool integration and can be extended for A2A compatibility.

**Setup**:
```bash
pip install openai
# Ensure you have an OpenAI API key set in environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

**Basic Agent Setup**:
```python
from openai.agents import Agent
from openai.agents.run_context import RunContextWrapper

# Define an agent
agent = Agent(
    name="TravelPlanner",
    instructions="Plan a trip by booking flights and hotels based on user preferences."
)
```

#### Step 2: Integrate MCP for Tool Access
MCP enables agents to connect to external tools (e.g., flight booking APIs, hotel databases). You can use an existing MCP server (e.g., for filesystem access or API calls) or create a custom one.

**Example: Connecting to an MCP Filesystem Server**:[](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/)
```python
from openai.agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio
from openai.agents import Agent

async def setup_mcp_agent():
    # Initialize an MCP server for filesystem access
    async with MCPServerStdio(
        params={
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/data"]
        }
    ) as mcp_server:
        # Create an agent with the MCP server
        agent = Agent(
            name="TravelPlanner",
            instructions="Use tools to access travel data and book services.",
            mcp_servers=[mcp_server]
        )
        run_context = RunContextWrapper(context=None)
        # List available tools
        tools = await mcp_server.list_tools(run_context, agent)
        print(f"Available tools: {tools}")
        return agent

# Run the agent (use asyncio to execute)
import asyncio
asyncio.run(setup_mcp_agent())
```

**Custom MCP Server**:
If you need a custom MCP server (e.g., for a travel API), you can implement one using the MCP Go SDK or Python frameworks like `mcp-agent`. For example, a server for a flight booking API might expose tools like `search_flights` and `book_flight`. Refer to the MCP documentation for server implementation details.[](https://agnt.one/blog/the-model-context-protocol-for-ai-agents)[](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent)

#### Step 3: Enable A2A for Agent Collaboration
A2A allows agents to communicate and delegate tasks. For example, one agent might handle flight searches while another negotiates hotel bookings. A2A uses Agent Cards (JSON descriptors) for capability discovery and HTTP-based communication for task coordination.

**Example: A2A Integration**:
Since A2A is newer and less widely adopted than MCP, you may need to implement a custom A2A client/server or use an existing framework like Google’s A2A SDK (if available) or Strands Agents from AWS. Below is a conceptual example of how A2A could be integrated with the OpenAI Agents SDK.[](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/open-protocols-for-agent-interoperability-part-1-inter-agent-communication-on-mcp/)[](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/)

```python
import requests
import json

# Define an A2A Agent Card (simplified)
agent_card = {
    "id": "TravelPlannerAgent",
    "capabilities": ["search_flights", "book_flight", "coordinate_tasks"],
    "endpoint": "https://travel-agent.example.com/a2a",
    "auth": {"type": "OAuth2", "token_endpoint": "https://auth.example.com"}
}

# Register the agent with an A2A server
def register_a2a_agent(card):
    response = requests.post("https://a2a-registry.example.com/register", json=card)
    return response.json()

# Delegate a task to another agent via A2A
def delegate_task(task, remote_agent_endpoint):
    task_payload = {
        "task_id": "flight_search_001",
        "description": "Search for flights from NYC to LAX on 2025-08-10",
        "priority": "high"
    }
    response = requests.post(f"{remote_agent_endpoint}/tasks", json=task_payload)
    return response.json()

# Example usage
registered = register_a2a_agent(agent_card)
print(f"Agent registered: {registered}")

# Delegate a task to a remote agent
result = delegate_task("search_flights", "https://flight-agent.example.com/a2a")
print(f"Task result: {result}")
```

**Note**: A2A adoption is still emerging, and specific SDKs may not be fully available. You may need to build custom HTTP-based A2A clients/servers based on the protocol’s JSON-RPC specification. Check Google’s A2A documentation for updates.[](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/a2a)

#### Step 4: Orchestrate the Agentic Web Workflow
The Agentic Web requires agents to plan, decompose, and execute tasks across services. Using the OpenAI Agents SDK, you can create a multi-agent system where:
- A **Head Agent** (orchestrator) decomposes the user’s request (e.g., “Plan a trip to Paris”).
- **Specialized Agents** (e.g., Flight Agent, Hotel Agent) use MCP to access tools and A2A to collaborate.
- The system returns a synthesized result to the user.

**Example: Multi-Agent Travel Planning**:[](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/agents_sdk/multi-agent-portfolio-collaboration/multi_agent_portfolio_collaboration)
```python
from openai.agents import Agent, Orchestrator
from openai.agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio
from openai.agents.llm import OpenAIAugmentedLLM

async def run_travel_workflow():
    # Define MCP servers for tools (e.g., flight and hotel APIs)
    flight_mcp = MCPServerStdio(params={"command": "npx", "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/flight-api"]})
    hotel_mcp = MCPServerStdio(params={"command": "npx", "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/hotel-api"]})

    # Define specialized agents
    flight_agent = Agent(
        name="FlightAgent",
        instructions="Search and book flights using the flight API.",
        mcp_servers=[flight_mcp]
    )
    hotel_agent = Agent(
        name="HotelAgent",
        instructions="Search and book hotels using the hotel API.",
        mcp_servers=[hotel_mcp]
    )

    # Define orchestrator
    orchestrator = Orchestrator(
        llm_factory=OpenAIAugmentedLLM,
        available_agents=[flight_agent, hotel_agent],
        instructions="Plan a trip by coordinating flight and hotel bookings."
    )

    # Run the workflow
    user_request = "Plan a trip to Paris from NYC for August 10-15, 2025."
    response = await orchestrator.run(user_request, max_turns=20)
    print(f"Travel plan: {response.final_output}")

# Execute the workflow
asyncio.run(run_travel_workflow())
```

#### Step 5: Add Safety and Observability
The Agentic Web emphasizes safety and governance. The OpenAI Agents SDK provides guardrails and observability features:
- **Guardrails**: Restrict tool access or require human approval for sensitive actions (e.g., booking payments).
- **Observability**: Use tracing to monitor agent actions and debug workflows.

**Example: Adding Guardrails**:[](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/openais-agents-sdk-and-anthropics-model-context-protocol-mcp)
```python
from openai.agents.mcp import createMCPToolStaticFilter

# Restrict tools to specific actions
tool_filter = createMCPToolStaticFilter(allowed_tools=["search_flights", "book_flight"])
agent = Agent(
    name="FlightAgent",
    instructions="Book flights with restrictions.",
    mcp_servers=[flight_mcp],
    tool_filters=[tool_filter]
)
```

#### Step 6: Deploy and Scale
- **Deployment**: Host MCP servers on cloud platforms like AWS or Vercel, which support MCP integration. Use A2A-compatible platforms (e.g., Google Cloud) for agent collaboration.[](https://agnt.one/blog/the-model-context-protocol-for-ai-agents)[](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/open-protocols-for-agent-interoperability-part-1-inter-agent-communication-on-mcp/)
- **Scaling**: Use frameworks like `mcp-agent` for model-agnostic multi-agent patterns (e.g., Swarm) and cache tool lists to reduce latency.[](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent)[](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js/guides/mcp/)

### Challenges and Considerations
1. **A2A Adoption**: As of August 2025, A2A is less mature than MCP, with limited SDK availability. You may need to implement custom A2A clients/servers, which requires familiarity with JSON-RPC and HTTP.[](https://agnt.one/blog/the-model-context-protocol-for-ai-agents)[](https://www.koyeb.com/blog/a2a-and-mcp-start-of-the-ai-agent-protocol-wars)
2. **Security**: Ensure secure authentication (e.g., OAuth2, mTLS) for MCP and A2A interactions to prevent context injection or unauthorized access.[](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/open-protocols-for-agent-interoperability-part-1-inter-agent-communication-on-mcp/)[](https://tutorials.botsfloor.com/what-every-ai-engineer-should-know-about-a2a-mcp-acp-8335a210a742?gi=5afddaa20e8e)
3. **Interoperability**: While MCP is widely supported, A2A’s ecosystem is enterprise-focused and may not integrate seamlessly with all frameworks. Test compatibility with your stack (e.g., LangChain, CrewAI).[](https://www.knowi.com/blog/ai-agent-protocols-explained-what-are-a2a-and-mcp-and-why-they-matter/)
4. **Naming Confusion**: A2A’s name overlaps with “account-to-account” in fintech, which may complicate resource discovery. Use precise search terms like “A2A Agent-to-Agent protocol.”[](https://agnt.one/blog/the-model-context-protocol-for-ai-agents)

### Example Use Case: Travel Planning Agentic Web
- **User Request**: “Plan a trip to Paris from NYC, August 10-15, 2025, budget $2000.”
- **Head Agent**: Decomposes the task into flight search, hotel booking, and itinerary planning.
- **MCP Integration**: Flight Agent uses an MCP server to query a flight API; Hotel Agent queries a hotel database.
- **A2A Collaboration**: Flight Agent delegates to Hotel Agent via A2A to ensure hotel availability aligns with flight dates.
- **Output**: A synthesized travel plan with booked flights, hotels, and a suggested itinerary.

### Conclusion
Using the OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP, and A2A, you can implement an Agentic Web system where agents autonomously handle tasks by accessing tools (via MCP) and collaborating with other agents (via A2A). The SDK provides a robust foundation for orchestration, MCP ensures standardized tool access, and A2A enables scalable agent-to-agent communication. While MCP is mature and widely supported, A2A requires careful integration due to its emerging status. Start with MCP for tool integration and gradually incorporate A2A as its ecosystem grows. For a practical start, explore the `mcp-agent` framework and OpenAI’s sample code for multi-agent workflows.[](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent)[](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/agents_sdk/multi-agent-portfolio-collaboration/multi_agent_portfolio_collaboration)
